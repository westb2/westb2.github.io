I am a hydrologist interested in better understanding spaces that exist at the intersection of people and the environment. Currently, my research focuses on incorporating dams and reservoirs into large scale hydrologic models. I plan to use these models to ask questions about future water security, environmental stewardship practices, how water has been redistributed among society historically, and more. I am also interested in building tools for others to use via open science practices. 

Presently a hydrology PhD student at the University of Arizona with Dr. Laura Condon. Previously, I received a dual degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Afterwards  I worked in consulting building technology solutions for large companies across sectors such as energy, manufacturing, education, food, finance, and more. During my free time I enjoy playing games and sports of all sorts, as well as exploring the beautiful state of Arizona.
